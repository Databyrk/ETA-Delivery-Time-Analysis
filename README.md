ETA prediction and delivery performance analysis using Python
## 🚀 ETA Delivery Time Analysis

**End-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding delivery time (ETA) drivers and operational performance in food delivery platforms.**

This project applies **Python, SQL-style analysis, and data visualization** to identify patterns affecting delivery delays and efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze **food delivery operations data** and answer key business questions such as:

- What factors impact delivery time?
- How does distance affect ETA?
- Which order types take longer?
- Is delivery workload balanced across delivery partners?
- What percentage of deliveries are late?

---

## 📊 Key KPIs & Insights

- ⏱ **Average Delivery Time:** ~26 minutes  
- 🚨 **Late Delivery Rate:** ~30% (deliveries > 30 minutes)  
- 📍 **Distance vs Time:** Delivery time increases significantly beyond 10 km  
- 👨‍🍳 **Order Type Impact:** Meal orders take slightly longer on average  
- 👥 **Workload Balance:** High variance in orders per delivery partner
